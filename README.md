## Operating System Engineering

This repository shares the learning process of the course 6.S081 with online materials from MIT. The results are divided into the following two parts:

1. Labs solutions (with commit history) in [this repository](https://github.com/splendidField/xv6-labs-2020) 
   - Different labs are in different branches.
   - Handins are also uploaded for convenience.

2. Notes of lectures, readings, labs, and especially xv6's code.
   - Notes of xv6's code categorize the code into different parts and briefly explain the functionality and  mechanism.
